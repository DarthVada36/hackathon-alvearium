## Pinned runtime dependencies used during development
# These pins were captured from the project's .venv on Windows to help
# reproducible installs for teammates. If you use Docker, consider
# keeping Python minor version consistent (recommend Python 3.11).

# Notes:
# - If installation fails on Windows due to binary wheel incompatibilities, prefer
#   using Python 3.11 (matching the environment used to capture these pins), or
#   run the app inside Docker where wheels are pre-built.
